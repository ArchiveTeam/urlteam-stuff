Welcome to the Urlteam website. The Urlteam is the <a
href="http://www.archiveteam.org/">ArchiveTeam</a> subcomitee on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortener">URL shorteners</a>. We
believe that they pose a serious threat to the internet's integrity. If one of
them dies, gets hacked or sells out, millions of links will stop working. Thus
we preemptively release backups, because URL shorteners are too busy to make
backups themselves.
            </p>

            <h2>Releases</h2>
            <p>
Every 6 months we release a torrent of all backed up files. When a new torrent
is released, you can simply delete the old torrent and download the new files
in the same location. Your BitTorrent client will figure out which files have
changed and will redownload them, even if you weren't finished yet on the
previous torrent.
            </p>
            <p>
The latest torrent was released on February 8th, 2011: <a
href="urlteam-data-2011-02-08.torrent">urlteam-data-2011-02-08.torrent</a>
            </p>
            <p>
The next release is planned for August 2011.
            </p>

            <h2>Data format</h2>
            <p>
All data files in the torrent are simple text files compressed using <a
href="http://tukaani.org/xz/format.html">LZMA2/xz</a>. The text file format is
very simple: Each line contains one mapping in the following format: Shortcode,
pipe (Ascii 0x7C), long URL, line feed (Ascii 0x10). The file is sorted by
shortcodes using the following order:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shorter shortcodes come before longer ones</li>
                <li>Decimal digits</li>
                <li>Lowercase letters</li>
                <li>Uppercase letters</li>
                <li>ASCII value</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
Depending on the URL shortener there might be multiple long URLs for one
shortcode.
            </p>
            <p>
There are some tools for working with the files on <a
href="https://github.com/soult/urlteam-stuff">GitHub</a>.

                <h2>Q&amp;A</h2>
                <h4>Can you do a backup shortener XY please?</h4>
                <p>
Maybe. Some shorteners are very fast at banning scrapers which makes it
impossible to do a backup in an efficient way. Contact us and we may look into
it.
                </p>
                <h4>What about 301works.org? They help URL shorteners with backups.</h4>
                <p>
And yet they haven't released a single file for download.
