Welcome to the URLTeam website. The URLTeam is the <a
href="http://www.archiveteam.org/">ArchiveTeam</a> subcommittee on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortener">URL shorteners</a>. We
believe that they pose a serious threat to the internet's integrity. If one of
them dies, gets hacked or sells out, millions of links will stop working. Thus
we preemptively release backups, because URL shorteners are too busy to make
backups themselves.
            </p>

            <h2>Releases</h2>
            <p>
Every 6 months or so we release a torrent of all backed up files. When a new
torrent is released, you can simply delete the old torrent and download the new
files to the same location. Your BitTorrent client will figure out which files
have changed and will redownload them, even if you weren't finished yet on the
previous torrent.
            </p>
            <p>
The latest torrent was released on Dec 31th, 2011: <a
href="releases/2011-12-31/urlteam.torrent">urlteam.torrent</a> - <a
href="releases/2011-12-31/filelist.txt">List of files</a> - <a
href="releases/2011-12-31/README.txt">Readme</a>
            </p>
            <p>
For our previous releases, see the <a href="releases/">releases</a>
subdirectory. The next release <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is
planned around July 2012</span> will be delayed until the end of 2012.
            </p>

            <h2>Data format</h2>
            <p>
All data files in the torrent are simple text files compressed using <a
href="http://tukaani.org/xz/format.html">LZMA2/xz</a>. The text file format is
very simple: Each line contains one mapping in the following format: Shortcode,
pipe (Ascii 0x7C), long URL, line feed (Ascii 0x10). The file is sorted by
shortcodes using the following order:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shorter shortcodes come before longer ones</li>
                <li>Decimal digits</li>
                <li>Lowercase letters</li>
                <li>Uppercase letters</li>
                <li>ASCII value</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
Depending on the URL shortener there might be multiple long URLs for one
shortcode.
            </p>
            <p>
There are some tools for working with the files on <a
href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/urlteam-stuff">GitHub</a>.

                <h2>Q&amp;A</h2>
                <h4>Can you do a backup of shortener XY please?</h4>
                <p>
Maybe. Some shorteners are very fast at banning scrapers which makes it
impossible to do a backup in an efficient way. Contact us and we will look into
it.
                </p>
                <h4>What about 301Works.org? They help URL shorteners with backups.</h4>
                <p>
Unfortunately they rely on the cooperation of URL shorteners, and many of the
biggest URL shorteners refuse to cooperate. Furthermore, they don't plan on
releasing any data files to the public. We do however greatly value their work
and when selecting which URL shorteners we will scrape next we concentrate
especially on those that don't cooperate with 301Works.
                </p>
                <p>
Since March 2011 we are actively uploading data from non-cooperating shorteners
to the 301Works archive. While those files are not available for download (they
contain the same data as our torrents anyway) you can watch our progress <a
href="http://www.archive.org/details/301utm">here</a>.
                </p>
                <h4>I like what you do. Can I help?</h4>
                <p>
Sure thing. We can always use people who help with scraping. Or programmers. We
could also use a fast server with lots of space for storing the data and
seeding the torrents. Anyhow, if you want to help, please contact us.
                </p>
                <h4>What's with all those weird directory and file names in the torrent?</h4>
                <p>
It's hard to organize that stuff into files so that each individual file is
only a few hundred megabytes in size. Because we want to accomodate people with
inferior operating systems we also need to assume a case insensitive file
system.
