                   URLTeam URL Shortener Backup Torrent v1

  ===========================================================================

  This torrent is a collection of scraped data from various URL shorteners put
  together by the URLTeam. The URLTeam is the ArchiveTeam subcommittee on URL
  shorteners. We believe that they pose a serious threat to the internet's
  integrity. If one of them dies, gets hacked or sells out, millions of links
  will stop working. Thus we preemptively release backups, because URL
  shorteners are too busy to make backups themselves. 

  ===========================================================================

  All data files in the torrent are simple text files compressed using
  LZMA2/xz. The text file format is very simple: Each line contains one
  mapping in the following format: Shortcode, pipe (Ascii 0x7C), long URL,
  line feed (Ascii 0x10). The file is sorted by shortcodes using the following
  order:
  
    * Shorter shortcodes come before longer ones
    * Decimal digits
    * Lowercase letters
    * Uppercase letters
    * ASCII value

  Depending on the URL shortener there might be multiple long URLs for one
  shortcode.

  There are some tools for working with the files on GitHub:

  ===========================================================================

  Some notes:

  File Layout: With our last torrent (the Geocities torrent) we had problems
  with Windows users because the default filesystem for Windows is case
  insensitive. For this reason we have organized the files into various
  sub-folders and appended "lowercase" or "uppercase" to give Windows users a
  chance to download this torrent.

  Tr.im: Because Eric Woodward (owner of tr.im) is too stupid to actually
  code a working URL shortener, the tr.im.txt.xz file is both incomplete and
  possibly includes wrong URLs. Again: This is not a problem on our side, this
  is simply tr.im returning wrong URLs depending on the day of the week, the
  current sign of the zodiac, the tide at Norfolk Station and possibly some
  other factors. (@Eric: Please, please tell me you don't work in programming
  anymore.)
